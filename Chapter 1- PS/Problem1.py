print('''Good, better, best,
Never let it rest,
Till your good is better,
And your better is best.

Wake up with a smile,
Try and go the extra mile.
Even if the task feels tough,
Trying hard is good enough.

Learn from every fall,
Stand up strong and tall.
Mistakes are how we grow,
Much more than we know.

Be kind in what you do,
Help your classmates too.
A gentle word, a cheerful face,
Can brighten up the place.

Practice every day,
Even when you want to play.
Hard work makes you smart,
So give it all your heart.

Good, better, best,
Always do your best,
With courage in your chest,
Youâ€™ll stand out from the rest!''')
